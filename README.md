# EndlessRunner instructions.

Jump with space for the first player. Jump with up arrow key for the second player. Your goal is to survive from spikes and falling blocks of stones.

[Obstacles have a chance to vanishing if one jumps over them and local co op is working](a6a926179b4081b80ebc14962e60945fe8fbed4f)
When the player jumps over the obstacle the have 25% chance to vanish. Also after endless tries and testing. I can finally say that the second player is now not only be able to move but also has physics! This was a huge problem for not me, but many others. From my previous that was not working as intended. [Local op is not working!](ce04a4baca43db76a33d42c75f808ccf11c45383)

I can shamefully say I was unable to meet my progress. I tried to implement local co op. But it did not work especially for the second player. [All these commits may mean nothing, but these are the first testing period of when I tried to implement local co op.](7c17e1d8243964266a8a964d5880215e2b5c2793)
